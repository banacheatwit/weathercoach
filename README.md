Software Engineering Final Project

The system our team is planning to develop is a weather app designed for mobile devices that focuses on a clean GUI and outfit recommendations for users based on the weather. The program will recommend an outfit choice for the given weather. Based on a user’s location and that location’s weather, it will display a list of recommended articles of clothing such as “t-shirt, long pants, sunglasses” or “winter coat, heavy pants, thermal layers, boots.” This will aid people who struggle with decision making early in the morning and will use technology to create a frictionless and accurate morning routine.
